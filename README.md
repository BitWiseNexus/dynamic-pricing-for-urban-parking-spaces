# ðŸ“‘ Final Report: Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Spaces

---

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Urban parking presents a significant logistical and economic challenge due to its limited availability and high demand variability. Traditional static pricing mechanisms often result in inefficienciesâ€”either leading to underutilization of available parking or excessive congestion.

This project investigates and implements **dynamic pricing strategies** using real-time data to enhance efficiency and demand responsiveness. Two pricing models were developed and evaluated:

- **Model 1:** Linear Occupancy-Based Pricing (Baseline)
- **Model 2:** Multi-Factor Demand-Based Pricing

Both models are implemented using **NumPy** and **Pandas**, with parameter tuning via **grid search** to optimize pricing stability and responsiveness.

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Description

The dataset comprises detailed records from **14 urban parking locations** collected over a period of **73 days**, segmented into **18 half-hour intervals daily** (from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM). The dataset includes the following features:

- Occupancy  
- Capacity  
- Queue Length  
- Traffic Conditions  
- Special Day Indicator (e.g., festivals, public holidays)  
- Vehicle Type  

This data enables temporal, spatial, and behavioral analysis of parking demand.

## ðŸ“Œ Model 1: Baseline Linear Price Adjustment Model

### ðŸ“– Pricing Function

A straightforward model that adjusts price in proportion to changes in occupancy:

NewPrice_t = PreviousPrice_t + Î± Ã— (Occupancy_t - PrevOccupancy_t) / (Capacity - PrevOccupancy_t)

Where:
- **Î± (alpha)** controls the price sensitivity to occupancy change.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Assumptions

- Price resets to a **base value of \$10** at the start of each day.  
- Pricing changes linearly with occupancy variation.  
- No additional factors are considered.  

---

### ðŸ“Š Optimization Strategy

A **grid search** over various alpha values was conducted to minimize the **mean of day-wise standard deviation in pricing**, promoting smoother daily price transitions.

## ðŸ“Œ Model 2: Multi-Factor Demand-Based Pricing Model

### ðŸ“– Demand and Pricing Function

This model introduces a more comprehensive demand function incorporating multiple influencing factors:

Demand = Î± Ã— (Occupancy / Capacity) + Î² Ã— QueueLength - Î³ Ã— TrafficCondition + Î´ Ã— IsSpecialDay + Îµ Ã— VehicleTypeWeight

The price is then computed as:

NewPrice_t = BasePrice Ã— (1 + Î» Ã— NormalizedDemand)

Where:
- **Î»** is a demand scaling coefficient (set to 0.6).
- Prices are capped within the range **[0.5Ã—, 2Ã—]** of the base price.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Assumptions

- Demand factors are linearly combined.  
- Demand is normalized daily to ensure consistency.  
- Prices are bounded to prevent volatility.  
- Traffic and vehicle type are encoded numerically:  

  - **Traffic Conditions:** {Low: 0.3, Medium: 0.6, High: 1.0}  
  - **Vehicle Types:** {Car: 1.0, Bike: 0.7, Truck: 1.3}  

---

### ðŸ“Š Optimization Strategy

A grid search was conducted over combinations of (Î±, Î², Î³, Î´, Îµ) to minimize the **mean standard deviation of daily price changes**, ensuring stability without sacrificing demand responsiveness.

---

## ðŸ“Š Pricing Behavior Overview

The pricing dynamics follow intuitive patterns:

- **High Occupancy or Queue Length:** Indicates strong demand, resulting in price increases.  
- **High Traffic Congestion:** Reduces parking accessibility, decreasing demand and thus price.  
- **Special Days:** Tend to attract higher traffic, warranting price adjustments upward.  
- **Vehicle Type:** Adjusts demand weight based on expected space usage and vehicle impact.  

These effects are moderated by:
- **Daily normalization** of demand  
- **Pricing bounds**  
- **Smoothness-driven optimization**  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Evaluation

In line with the project guidelines, no single quantitative metric was mandated. The models were evaluated based on:

- **Smoothness** of price transitions  
- **Responsiveness** to realistic changes in demand  
- **Interpretability** and clarity of pricing logic  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

- **Model 1** serves as a reliable baseline but lacks responsiveness to multifaceted demand signals.  
- **Model 2** demonstrates a more sophisticated and realistic pricing mechanism, adjusting to a broader set of contextual variables.  
- Optimization efforts ensure that pricing remains **stable, explainable, and adaptive** to real-time demand fluctuations.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Future Directions

Potential avenues for enhancing this framework include:

- Incorporating **revenue or profit maximization** as an explicit objective  
- Imposing **responsiveness constraints** to avoid overly stable (and ineffective) pricing  
- Leveraging **machine learning models** or **non-linear regression** for dynamic parameter adaptation and learning-based decision-making
