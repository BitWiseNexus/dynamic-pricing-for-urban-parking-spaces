📑 Final Report: Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Spaces
📌 Introduction
Urban parking presents a significant logistical and economic challenge due to its limited availability and high demand variability. Traditional static pricing mechanisms often result in inefficiencies—either leading to underutilization of available parking or excessive congestion.

This project investigates and implements dynamic pricing strategies using real-time data to enhance efficiency and demand responsiveness. Two pricing models were developed and evaluated:

Model 1: Linear Occupancy-Based Pricing (Baseline)

Model 2: Multi-Factor Demand-Based Pricing

Both models are implemented using NumPy and Pandas, with parameter tuning via grid search to optimize pricing stability and responsiveness.

📌 Dataset Description
The dataset comprises detailed records from 14 urban parking locations collected over a period of 73 days, segmented into 18 half-hour intervals daily (from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM). The dataset includes the following features:

Occupancy

Capacity

Queue Length

Traffic Conditions

Special Day Indicator (e.g., festivals, public holidays)

Vehicle Type

This data enables temporal, spatial, and behavioral analysis of parking demand.

📌 Model 1: Baseline Linear Price Adjustment Model
📖 Pricing Function
A straightforward model that adjusts price in proportion to changes in occupancy:

Where:

α (alpha) controls the price sensitivity to occupancy change.

📌 Assumptions
Price resets to a base value of $10 at the start of each day.

Pricing changes linearly with occupancy variation.

No additional factors are considered.

📊 Optimization Strategy
A grid search over various alpha values was conducted to minimize the mean of day-wise standard deviation in pricing, promoting smoother daily price transitions.

📌 Model 2: Multi-Factor Demand-Based Pricing Model
📖 Demand and Pricing Function
This model introduces a more comprehensive demand function incorporating multiple influencing factors:

NewPrice

Where:

λ is a demand scaling coefficient (set to 0.6).

Prices are capped within the range [0.5×, 2×] of the base price.

📌 Assumptions
Demand factors are linearly combined.

Demand is normalized daily to ensure consistency.

Prices are bounded to prevent volatility.

Traffic and vehicle type are encoded numerically:

Traffic Conditions: {Low: 0.3, Medium: 0.6, High: 1.0}

Vehicle Types: {Car: 1.0, Bike: 0.7, Truck: 1.3}

📊 Optimization Strategy
A grid search was conducted over combinations of (α, β, γ, δ, ε) to minimize the mean standard deviation of daily price changes, ensuring stability without sacrificing demand responsiveness.

📊 Pricing Behavior Overview
The pricing dynamics follow intuitive patterns:

High Occupancy or Queue Length: Indicates strong demand, resulting in price increases.

High Traffic Congestion: Reduces parking accessibility, decreasing demand and thus price.

Special Days: Tend to attract higher traffic, warranting price adjustments upward.

Vehicle Type: Adjusts demand weight based on expected space usage and vehicle impact.

These effects are moderated by:

Daily normalization of demand

Pricing bounds

Smoothness-driven optimization

📌 Evaluation
In line with the project guidelines, no single quantitative metric was mandated. The models were evaluated based on:

Smoothness of price transitions

Responsiveness to realistic changes in demand

Interpretability and clarity of pricing logic

📌 Conclusion
Model 1 serves as a reliable baseline but lacks responsiveness to multifaceted demand signals.

Model 2 demonstrates a more sophisticated and realistic pricing mechanism, adjusting to a broader set of contextual variables.

Optimization efforts ensure that pricing remains stable, explainable, and adaptive to real-time demand fluctuations.

📌 Future Directions
Potential avenues for enhancing this framework include:

Incorporating revenue or profit maximization as an explicit objective.

Imposing responsiveness constraints to avoid overly stable (and ineffective) pricing.

Leveraging machine learning models or non-linear regression for dynamic parameter adaptation and learning-based decision-making.
